# External Dependencies

This file directory contains external dependencies to mmSolver.
 
You may run individual build or downlowd scripts, however running from the project root will most likely be easier. 
 
```commandline
$ cd <project root>
$ sh build_with_only_levmar.sh
```

Or with Intel Math Kernel Libraries:
```commandline
$ cd <project root>
$ sh build_with_intel_mkl.sh
```
