# External Dependencies

This file directory contains external dependencies to mmSolver.
 
You may run individual build or download scripts, however running from
the project root will most likely be easier.
 
```commandline
$ cd <project root>
$ sh build_with_levmar.sh

Or with ATLAS:
```commandline
$ cd <project root>
$ sh build_with_atlas.sh```

Or with Intel Math Kernel Libraries:
```commandline
$ cd <project root>
$ sh build_with_intel_mkl.sh
```
